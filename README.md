# Control Center

## A reimagined homepage to facilitate productivity by organizing links, notes, and a To-Do list into specialized categories.

Ever wish your browser offered a way of organizing your school-related bookmarks into categories while in 'research mode' for a class project? Or having all those saved links for those things you want to buy when you can finally afford them, be sorted into specific views depending on what they are for? Or let's say you are really into a videogame and want to keep notes for strategies you've come up with, or save some links to videos for you to reference, while having a personalized to-do list for things you want to accomplish in-game? 
Well with the Control Center Organizational tool, all of that is easily-accomplished!
